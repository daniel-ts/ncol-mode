#+TITLE: Emacs ncol-mode

This package supplies the global =ncol-mode= minor mode that defines a couple of
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Buffer-Display-Action-Functions.html][display-buffer action functions]] which new buffers in a column next to the
current column. When a threshold on the width is reached, the columns are split
horizontally.

I find it very simple but pleasant.
